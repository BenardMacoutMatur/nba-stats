<p>As crarzy as it seems N.Jokic droped this stat line on the Phoenix Suns, although the team still lost this game on the post season</p>
<p>This is one of the most dominant perfomance ever seen from a center, having seen a Dominant Shaq Drop 61 points against the Clippers on his birthday having seen Joel Embiid drop 50 pts on the Boston Celtics during the Regular season, this is up there with the best stat line one can ever see.</p>
